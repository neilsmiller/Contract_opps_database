    <h1>Sole Source Spotter</h1>

<div class="intro-text">
    <p>Welcome to the Sole Source Spotter. This site provides a regularly updated view of Federal contracting notices posted on SAM.gov, and highlights notices of intent to sole source.</p>

    <h2>What are sole source contracts?</h2>
    <p>In federal contracting, "sole source" procurement allows agencies to award contracts directly to a specific vendor without competitive bidding when they determine only one source can meet their requirements. The process begins when an agency identifies such a need and publishes a "Notice of Intent to Sole Source" on SAM.gov, explaining their justification and naming the intended vendor. Other companies then have a brief window (typically 10-15 days) to submit "capability statements" proving they could also fulfill the requirements. If no credible alternatives emerge, the agency proceeds with the sole source award; if viable alternatives are identified, they may convert to a competitive process.</p>

    <p>Notices on pending sole source awards are tucked away behind the SAM.gov login page, and require you to navigate through a free-text search and manually download attachments. The Sole Source Spotter makes these public documents truly transparent, so that potential vendors and all Americans have a heads-up <i>before</i> a sole source award is made.

We anticipate providing additional information in the near future. *** *** UPDATE 21 FEB 2025: Given the scope and significance of the revisions to the AIS@P Draft RFP underway, ACC-APG has elected to temporarily suspend its one-on-one feedback sessions, which had been established to solicit targeted feedback on the initial draft Request for Proposal (RFP). The ACC-APG anticipates resuming these sessions upon the release of the revised draft RFP in the next two weeks, at which point industry stakeholders will once again have the opportunity to engage in direct dialogue. In the meantime, industry partners are encouraged to contact the Project Linchpin office at usarmy.apg.peo-iews.mbx.linchpin@army.mil to arrange technical one-on-one discussions, providing a conduit for ongoing collaboration and insight-sharing. Notably, Project Linchpin is empowered to facilitate these sessions up until the issuance of the Final RFP, thereby ensuring that industry stakeholders maintain a consistent channel for providing input, exploring requirements, and showcasing their capabilities throughout the procurement process.*** *** UPDATE 16 JAN 2025: The information to include in the request was revised below. *** The Government is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit feedback, questions, and input from industry on the prospective AIS@P Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) in support of PEO IEW&S. This RFI is following the Virtual Industry Day held on January 7, 2025, where the Government presented an overview of the AIS@P contract vehicle and discussed the need for additional market research and direct engagement with industry. The posting for the Industry Day, with attached slides presented that day, can be found here: https://sam.gov/opp/b6ad7c59539a49deabcd39bed465ea8b/view As outlined during the Virtual Industry Day, the Government is seeking to gather more information and input from industry to inform the development of the AIS@P MATOC. The purpose of this RFI is to gather input from potential offerors on the existing Draft Request for Proposal (RFP). The Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) can be found here: https://sam.gov/opp/c252bad14e5b4eddb53ef3dbea9b78f4/view One-on-One Sessions As part of this RFI, the Government intends to conduct one-on-one sessions with selected interested vendors. These sessions will provide an opportunity for industry to discuss their ideas, provide feedback, and ask questions related to the AIS@P MATOC. The one-on-one sessions are scheduled to begin after the date of this RFI posting. To participate in a one-on-one session, companies must submit a written request to the Contracting Officer and Contract Specialist no later than COB Friday, 24 January 2025. The request should include the following information: Company name CAGE/UEI Point of contact Requirement Pool and sub-pools of interest Short BLUF on your company and insight regarding the topics/questions of interest below Selection of Vendors for One-on-One Sessions Please note that due to resource constraints, the Government unfortunately does not have the capacity to meet with every responding vendor. However, we intend to hold 40 one-on-one sessions; 20 sessions for each of the two Requirements Pools (RPs): RP1 (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) and RP2 (Software). Vendors will be selected for one-on-one sessions based on their written submissions, responsiveness to the Government, the Government\u2019s discretion to meet with vendors that appear to have information of interest to the Government, and with consideration given to ensuring a diverse range of participants. The Government reserves the right to hold more or fewer one-on-one sessions as the Government sees fit. Alternative Opportunity for Input Vendors that are not selected for a one-on-one session are encouraged to provide their written input and feedback on the AIS@P MATOC Draft RFP, to include any questions that vendors would like the Government to answer. Please submit your comments, questions, and suggestions via email to the AIS@P group mailbox, Contracting Officer, and Contract Specialist (contact information is below) by COB Friday, 31 January 2025. ACC-APG and PEO IEW&S are compiling all questions submitted, including those received prior to, and during, the Virtual Industry Day, and will post a Q&A file to SAM.gov once it is completed. We value your input and will consider all feedback received in developing the AIS@P MATOC. Objectives of One-on-One Sessions The general objectives of the one-on-one sessions are to: Increase industry understanding of government requirements Provide industry with an opportunity to surface perceived issues and concerns Allow the Government to hear industry responses and comments in general terms Enable the Government and industry to better understand each other's perspectives Allow industry to showcase their production-ready solutions The specific topics/questions the Government is requesting industry input on are: Sections L&M of the Draft RFP ( https://sam.gov/opp/c252bad14e5b4eddb53ef3dbea9b78f4/view ). After review of the Government\u2019s Draft RFP does your company have feedback on the gate criteria for the sub-pools you are intending to propose to? In your opinion, what are ways to improve the gate criteria without eliminating meaningful competition? What is an example of a gate criteria that can be measured objectively? Are they any discriminators that the Government are missing for your sub-pool(s)? Important Notes Please note that the one-on-one sessions DO NOT: Provide industry an opportunity to brief their intended proposal Provide Government critique of potential offeror's intended approach Constitute initiation of the negotiation process The Government reserves the right to provide written responses to questions asked during the one-on-one sessions at a later date. Each one-on-one session will be limited to 45 minutes. Equal Access to Information If new information regarding this planned acquisition is released during the one-on-one sessions or in answer to written submissions, then the same information will be provided to all potential offerors, including those who do not attend the sessions. The Government will take care to avoid releasing contractor proprietary information and requests that contractors identify any proprietary information in their submissions. We look forward to receiving your feedback and input on the AIS@P MATOC. Please submit your written requests for one-on-one sessions or email your comments and suggestions to the below contacts by the dates indicated above.

This Request for Information/Sources Sought announcement is for planning and informational purposes only and shall NOT be considered as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this Sources Sought or furnishing the requested information. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of a Contractor's submission of responses to this Sources Sought, the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any Contractor's input resulting from this Sources Sought. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 15.201, responses to this Sources Sought are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This Request for Information/Sources Sought is hereby issued by Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, as part of market research seeking information to support the procurement of supplies and services associated with the Fleet Support Team (FST) and Organic Depot Requirements in support of the Next Generation Jammer \u2013 Midband (NGJ-MB) System. The NGJ-MB supplies include, but are not limited to, Weapons Replaceable Assemblies; Shop Replaceable Assemblies (SRA); Sub-SRAs; components and bit/ piece parts; ancillary equipment; and test equipment. The NGJ-MB services include, but are not limited to, Engineering and Technical Support, Logistics Support, repairs, System and Subsystem Integration, training, and product improvements. This effort is anticipated to be conducted on a sole source basis with Raytheon Company in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 3204(a)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is the fact that the Government does not own the Technical Data Package, the anticipated substantial duplicative costs to the Government to qualify another manufacturer and the anticipated unacceptable schedule delays. The cost to develop a technical data package suitable for competitive procurement would not be recovered through competition. The Government is seeking information from Contractors mitigating the sole-source basis cited above. Contractors with the capabilities and facilities to provide the production of supplies and support services listed above may provide information to indicate their intent and capability. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following: Submitter\u2019s Name Street Address, City, State, Zip Code Business Size Point of Contact (POC) POC Telephone Announcement Number: N0016425SNB39 A white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, production units, production quantity breaks, mitigate the reason why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above, and /or identify other Government contracts with similar efforts for the Government(s) consideration. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This Sources Sought is for planning purposes only and is issued solely for conducting market research in accordance with FAR Part 10. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. This does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal. The Government is NOT seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. This notice shall not be construed as a contract, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind by the Government. Specific responses will not disqualify or have an impact on participation and evaluation on future solicitations. Not responding to this Sources Sought does not preclude participation in any future solicitation. If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via (System for Award Management) SAM.GOV and/or Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) and interested parties must comply with that announcement. It is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor SAM.GOV and/or PIEE for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

Executive Summary In order to effectively engage peer and near-peer adversaries, the U.S. Air Force needs to develop, acquire and operate systems as a unified force across all domains (air, land, sea, space, cyber, and electromagnetic spectrum). The Department of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office (DAFRCO) in partnership with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Command, Control, Communication for Battle Management (AFLCMC/C3) seeks to develop a cross-cutter portfolio of complimentary/ linked projects and programs to support Joint All-Domain Command & Control (JADC2) and the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS). The Air Force intends to facilitate the rapid exploration and maturation of innovative technologies. The Air Force will support future operations by providing the critical surveillance, tactical edge communications, processing, networking, and battle management command and control capabilities to the joint warfighting force. ABMS is not envisioned as a single program of record, but rather an open architecture family of systems that enables capabilities via multiple integrated platforms. ABMS will realize the vision of JADC2 to enhance and expand capabilities by enabling any sensor to inform any shooter in any domain\u2014land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. In an interview with Air Force Magazine in April 2019, General Goldfein stated, \u201cIt is a significant move for the Air Force to shift from a platform solution on command and control and battle management to a network solution going forward, and our future in the business of joint warfighting is to ensure that we\u2019re taking every sensor and every shooter and connecting them together to overwhelm an adversary\u201d. Our aim is to have intelligence and targeting data transformed into timely and actionable information through trusted networks and intelligent algorithms that enable our people to focus on decisions. In this construct, information is a service, rather than a platform, and the layers of sensing and the communication pathways will provide reliability and assurance in contested environments.

NAVSUP intended to award purchase order on a sole source basis to L3 Harris. in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). L3 Harris. has been found to be the only company capable of providing the required Rover 6S Transceiver and Accessories. Market research indicates there is no other vendor reasonably available to meet the agency\u2019s needs which are summarized below. Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC) Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) Branch personnel have an evolving requirement to view aircraft targeting pod video downlink (VDL) during live fly range events from a Tactical Operations Center (TOC) and from observation posts (OP) at varying distances from target areas in the Fallon Range Training Complex (FRTC). Having the capability to view that information greatly enhances situational awareness, shortens the time to complete the mission, and greatly enhances safety. The ROVER 6S with the Enhanced Antenna Kit and Laptop will allow JCAS personnel to view the VDL from a greater distance than traditional hand held devices and it will work more effectively in a \u201cnoisier\u201d radio frequency (RF) environment, such as NAS Fallon. An additional benefit is that this specific equipment is used throughout the DoD. Having the ROVER 6S in the JCAS inventory will allow local and visiting personnel to train with it for familiarization and proficiency.

The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 541519, Other Computer Related Services, with a business size standard of $34 million. Sole Source Justification Blue Marble is the manufacturer of Global Mapper as well as the distributor and the only company to provide maintenance and support. Therefore, Blue Marble is the only vendor that we can obtain these products and services from as they have no distributors or resellers for purchases taking place within the United States. This particular brand name is essential to the requirement and market research indicates similar products do not meet or cannot be modified to meet agency needs. The Global Mapper product has been incorporated into our product development standard procedures for years. The ability to read data sources from within zip files, directly read binary raster format, automatically scale multiple elevation DEM\u2019s to the same color ramp and can directly read both LAZ and LAS elevation formats. Compared to other software we have tried, file display is faster and easier, leading to more efficient QA/QC. The Lidar module and graphic calculator provide capability we do not see in other software. This includes the ability to do vertical transformations, including tidal data and horizontal time dependent transformations by incorporating NOAA data and algorithms.

This sole-source action will acquire Architect-Engineering (A-E) services from the Designer of Record (DOR) in support of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC)/U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Former Grain Silo Storage Facility Groundwater Contamination Site, located in York, Nebraska. Hydrogeologic (HGL) is the Designer of Record for the original design of the treatment facility at the contamination site. This contract will be used to revise the design of the pump system to bring it into compliance with and to incorporate any changes or requirements identified since the original design completion. Engineering During Construction (EDC) phase services will also be acquired under this contract. The work performed under the intended contract action represents a continuation of the services originally provided by HGL, ensuring consistent application of the DOR\u2019s design intent and maintaining DOR responsibility throughout the construction phase.

However, that contract has expired and cannot be extended. This follow-on contract is necessary to provide A-E services, including but not limited to: Providing design clarifications and modifications Conducting site visits and inspections Ensuring compliance with Biddability, Constructability, Operability, Environmental, and Sustainability (BCOES) standards EDC phase services Reviewing construction submittals and RFIs Because HGL possesses extensive project-specific knowledge, experience, and expertise, awarding this contract to another firm would introduce significant risks, including: Increased costs due to revalidation of design and calculations Potential project delays while a new firm familiarizes itself with the existing design Loss of design continuity and technical inconsistencies As a result, HGL is the only firm capable of performing these services without unacceptable duplication of effort, cost, or delay. This Notice of Intent is published in accordance with FAR 5.201. All responses received within 15 calendar days of this posting will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely at the Government\u2019s discretion.

Measuring and manipulating the quantum state properties of electron spin systems is a critical part of the NPMG mission in quantum information science. To fulfill this requirement, NPMG requires a programmable microwave signal generator that will provide the necessary approximately 1-40 GHz microwave magnetic field to induce ESR transitions. Extensive market research performed has identified only one brand/model (Keysight E8267D) that is capable of meeting all the requirements. This generator is critical for achieving program goals in developing new quantum related measurements and creating new ways of detecting and manipulating quantum computing qbits to reach PML milestones in quantum information science. An identical Keysight Model E8267D PSG Vector Signal Generator that is interchangeable with an existing unit is required for several important reasons. An identical unit is required so that extensive NIST developed software can run without modification on the new unit saving the Government money in developing new software, 2. New experiments can be compared with data from the existing unit and be sure that all signal, noise, and RF signal generation is the same for standards data analysis and comparison. 3. A back up unit is required in the event that one unit fails so that they can be quickly interchanged and keep mission critical experiments running. NIST is seeking information from sources that may be capable of providing a commercial item solution, for a VSG that meets or exceeds the following specifications identified herein. All items must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award. Experimental, prototype, or custom items will not be considered.

    "description": "{\"description\":\"U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Center 2025 Industry Expo The C5ISR Center is hosting an engagement event open to all of industry, for the purpose of providing two-way collaboration on current and future technologies. 1. Who: The intended audience includes active and prospective industry partners. No media will be invited to attend. 2. When/Where: The two-day event is Tuesday 10 June \u2013 Wednesday 11 June. It will be held fully in-person at Aberdeen Proving Ground, in both the Myer Auditorium (Building 6000) and the APG Recreation Center gymnasium (Building 3326). 3. Purpose: The event will focus on the Center\u2019s growth areas across all six S&T core competencies. The intent is to remain technology-focused and not tied to any specific acquisition or contract action(s). The content briefed will better build an industrial base in areas where one presently lacks and identify industry partners for technologies yet undeveloped or initiated, and therefore without a solidified industry relationship. The two-way exchange will aid industry in identifying how best to invest internal research and development funds (IR&D), and surface innovative solutions already being explored by the Center or industry. C5ISR Center technology leads will share status of current project areas and expand into future growth opportunities across key mission areas. The discussions held will focus on technologies with new starts planned for FY27 through FY29, contributing to building the Army of 2040. 4. Format: The event will utilize a dual approach in delivery. The C5ISR Center will present investment areas, technology areas worth industry exploration and partnership (day one). The event will then transition to a symposium-style format (day two), with booths representing technology areas across the Center to anchor an exchange. For the second day\u2019s expo, industry may attend the morning session. The afternoon session of day two is reserved for government organizational partners or internal C5ISR attendees. 5. Registration: Each business entity (per each CAGE Code) will be entitled to register five (5) representatives to attend the event. Registration opens 0900 on Monday 14 April 2025 and may be accessed through the following link: https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/ev/reg/kjk5fwj/lp/cd590b52-7d96-4fad-a5f0-235caac98e7e.

    "description": "{\"description\":\"NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A BRAND NAME CONTRACT. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITVE PROPOSALS. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) intends to enter into a brand name firm fixed price contract via a Fair Opportunity solicitation amongst all USDA STRATUS Pool 3 BOA Holders under the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition, 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, for Salesforce Enterprise License Agreement for USDA. USDA is made up of twenty-nine (29) agencies and offices with approximately one hundred thousand (100,000) employees who serve the American people at more than 4,500 locations across the country and around the globe. The Salesforce SaaS Platform provides the critical support to multiple USDA agencies and program areas. The Salesforce software platform, which has been in production in the USDA for over 10 years, has expanded from a single application to various robust business platforms across several USDA agencies hosting more than 50 mission critical applications. Current USDA applications developed and maintained by Salesforce in support of critical mission areas include: APHIS eFile, RD Reconnect, AMS Specialty Crops, Farmers.gov and AskUSDA. This acquisition requires the Salesforce brand name software solution that is compatible with the existing infrastructure and deployed on Certified FedRAMP Moderate environment. The Salesforce brand name software functions as the USDA\u2019s Enterprise Software System used for engagement for end users and customers. The Salesforce brand provides and supports multiple functionalities across the USDA. In addition to the renewal of existing products, the USDA requires the flexibility to expand / upgrade future enhancements to the Salesforce application. The Salesforce platform includes ancillary products owned by Salesforce, such as Tableau dashboards and Mulesoft data management applications. There are several unique elements of the Salesforce platform that contribute to the brand name requirement. The primary factor is the security requirement certifying that the USDA Agency using any business software platform has an active Authority to Operate (ATO), in which Salesforce is compliant. The testing of a Salesforce comparable software adds four to six additional months from approval to the deployment of the new software after certification. The lag time required to test and certify a replacement for Salesforce would negatively impact 82,000 current licenses across the USDA. Market research was conducted to determine if it is feasible to migrate the USDA to a platform other than Salesforce. While other vendors could provide similar offerings of the Salesforce platform, no vendor was able to provide a single all-inclusive application platform like Salesforce. Research also determined that there is no way to link the existing Salesforce applications already in production to another offering without costly outside services, integration efforts, re-training of agency staff all while not having a negative impact on mission services and interruptions. Market research concluded that the use of a different software platform would lead to security vulnerabilities and would significantly impact the USDA\u2019s ability to provide mission delivery requirements. Market research validated that other similar products do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency\u2019s need for a variety of service delivery applications associated to Salesforce offerings. The unique features of Salesforce include the following: the ability to provide multi-tenant architecture, single pre-integration, built-in digital engagement channels, a hosted GovCloud FedRAMP certified environment, a mobile ready function right out of the box, upgrade processes, API driven processors, and a full lifecycle API integrated tool all included in a single application. No other vendor has the capability to provide all eight features in a single platform. This Notice of Intent is not considered an Invitation for Bids (IFB), Request for Proposals (RFP), or Request for Quotations (RFQ) nor does it restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. Responsible sources capable of providing the required services may identify their interest and technical capability to meet this requirement. The Government will not reimburse firms for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The associated NAICS code for this acquisition is 541519, with the exception for Information Technology Value Added Resellers, small business size standard of 150 employees. All responses must be submitted to the Government by email only to Christine Wallace at Christine.Wallace@usda.gov and shall be considered by the Agency. All responses must be submitted by 3:00 pm Eastern Time on Monday, March 3, 2025.\"}",

Due to ongoing research based in part from data provided by Clarus Financial Technology\u2019s products, continuation of that research must require any other product to meet or exceed the minimum features of Clarus\u2019 products so not to disrupt or render inaccurate former or current works in progress.

Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia, PA intends to award a sole source modification to an existing Firm Fixed Price contract (W912BU-17-D-0015) to RAMBOLL AMERICAS ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS (RAMBOLL), under authority 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2304(c)(l), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-l(b)(1)(ii). The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541330 Engineering Services with a size standard of $25,500,000. This IDIQ contract for Architect-Engineer services is to perform professional engineering and design service projects for various locations within the boundaries of the Philadelphia District (PA, NJ, DE, MD, NY) but could also include other states and districts covered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers North Atlantic Division\u2019s mission areas (NY, PA, NJ, DE, MD, VA, WV), and the District of Columbia. It is the Government\u2019s intent to increase the capacity of contract W912BU-17-D-0015 by $350,000 to a total capacity of $6.05M to ensure NAP is able to support several Geo-Environmental programs without a break in service. The existing Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) was awarded to Ramboll through Full Open Competition under the Brooks Act via Solicitation W912BU-16-R-0034. There is a high likelihood that modifications to existing Task Orders will be required due to unforeseen conditions and requirements. Additional capacity is needed to ensure funding is available for these likely future modifications as they are encountered, so that the projects can be advanced without delay. The existing contract holder (Romboll) is the only source that can provide continued unique services to maintain the overall delivery of supported projects. There is a high likelihood that modifications to existing Task Orders will be required due to unforeseen conditions and requirements. Task Orders under this IDIQ require modification with a value that exceeds available capacity. Additional capacity is needed to complete these Task Orders and any other contingencies for the other open work under the IDIQ so that the projects can be advanced without delay. Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-l(b)(1)(ii). A period of performance extension is not included in this modification. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.

PORTIONS OF MOORING DESIGN ARE PROPRIETARY TO CORTLAND AND HAVE BEEN TESTED IN THE FIELD TO SPECIFICATIONS THAT MEET OR EXCEED PMEL\u2019S REQUIREMENTS. CORTLAND HAS DEVELOPED A TECHNIQUE OF MACHINE SPLICING FIVE DIFFERENT DIAMETERS OF LINE, OF DIFFERENT COMPOSITION TO MAKE A SMOOTH SPLICE THAT RETAINS THE STRENGTH OF THE ORIGINAL LINES. ADDITIONALLY THEY HAVE DEVELOPED A PROPRIETARY METHOOD TO INCORPORATE A LEAD FILLED SECTION OF LINE ENCAPSULATED IN A CHAFE PROTECTIVE POLYURETHANE JACKET, AND A PROPRIETARY FISH BITE PROTECTION FOR SYNTHETIC LINES BY WRAPPING NEW AND INNOVATIVE KEVLAR FILM AROUND THE LINE. NO OTHER MANUFACTURER HAS DEVELOPED THE TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE A LINE OF THIS COMPLEXITY WITH THE REQUISITE FISH BITE PROTECTION AND THE INTEGRAL LEAD SECTIONS WHILE RETAINING THE SMOOTH TRANSITIONS BETWEEN THE VARIOUS SECTIONS OF LINE COMPONENTS.

This SAFO highlights ongoing jamming and spoofing incidents that can increase safety of flight risks due to possible loss of situational awareness and increased pilot and Air Traffic Control workload. The FAA has requested support from the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) to investigate the feasibility and expected performance of applying anti-jam (AJ)/anti-spoofing (AS) GPS/GNSS technology for use in civilian aircraft applications with an initial focus on Transport and Business Jet aircraft. NAWCAD is releasing this RFI on AJ/AS GPS/GNSS technologies for eventual use in civilian aircraft applications. This RFI is a study identifying and discussing the characteristics and performance of the vendors\u2019 AJ and AS antenna technologies that are currently available or being developed. The information learned from this RFI may be used to identify potential systems for evaluation testing at NAWCAD. Results from the RFI data and future evaluation testing will be used to develop updated GPS/GNSS AJ/AS antenna Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) and cockpit displays/annunciation MOPS for the FAA. NAWCAD is performing the study, hosting the industry day(s), and establishing Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) or technology agreements for test hardware, lab test, chamber test, and future flight test for the FAA.

Rapid, controlled, directional growth to create very large (500+ meter length) useful space structures would disrupt the current state-of-the-art and position biology as a complimentary component of the in-space assembly infrastructure. Some examples of structures that could be biologically manufactured and assembled, but that may be infeasible to produce traditionally, include tethers for a space elevator, grid-nets for orbital debris remediation, kilometer-scale interferometers for radio science, new self-assembled wings of a commercial space station for hosting additional payloads, or on-demand production of patch materials to adhere and repair micrometeorite damage.\"}",

    "description": "{\"description\":\"Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to enter into a collaboration to further develop and commercialize its additively manufactured targets for inertial confinement fusion. Background: Recent groundbreaking Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) experiments that showed the first instances that fusion ignition (i.e., more energy generated via fusion reaction compared to the laser energy driven onto a fusion fuel target) can be achieved at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Current target designs for ignition demand a deuterium-tritium (D-T) ice layer to be formed on the inner layer of the capsule - a complex process that can take multiple days. A capsule that can hold a layer of liquid fuel on its inner surface could simplify the fuel target fabrication and allow for the exploration of more complex phenomena, including higher ignition energy yield. Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, in particular two-photon lithography (TPL), have been proposed to fabricate such targets that would otherwise be impossible to mass manufacture using conventional means. TPL uses a laser beam to enable rapid fabrication of complex 3D structures with sub-wavelength resolved features by polymerization of photo-responsive liquid material. Description: LLNL researchers have developed additive manufactured fuel targets for IFE. They have been successful in using TPL to fabricate low density (down to 60 mg/cm3) and low atomic number (CHO) polymeric foams for potential targets, and some have been tested at the OMEGA Laser Facility. With TPL, LLNL researchers have also been able to fabricate a full fuel capsule with diameter of ~5 mm or less, and a capsule with an attached foam layer inside of the solid shell. Advantages/Benefits: Using a relatively simple AM process to print a low-density foam for liquid deuterium/tritium to wick into by capillary action and form a uniform fuel layer, this potentially does away with the need for the multi-day process to grow a deuterium/tritium ice layer inside an existing capsule. Potential Applications: High throughput system and method to fabricate fuel integral IFE targets for NIF and IFE target manufacture; scale up enables commercialization of IFE. Development Status: Current stage of technology development: TRL ? 0-2 ? 3-5 ? 5-9 LLNL has filed for patent protection on this invention. LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information. Please visit the IPO website at https://ipo.llnl.gov/resources for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process. Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Additively manufactured targets for inertial confinement fusion should provide an electronic OR written statement of interest, which includes the following: Company Name and address. The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact. A description of corporate expertise and/or facilities relevant to commercializing this technology. Please provide a complete electronic OR written statement to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Additively manufactured targets for inertial confinement fusion. The subject heading in an email response should include the Notice ID and/or the title of LLNL\u2019s Technology/Business Opportunity and directed to the Primary and Secondary Point of Contacts listed below. Written responses should be directed to: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Innovation and Partnerships Office P.O. Box 808, L-779 Livermore, CA 94551-0808 Attention: IL-13994\"}",

The applicable Product/Service Code is R418. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541110 - Office of Lawyers, which has a size standard of $11.0M. This requirement is to assist EXIM in its efforts to collect outstanding amounts owed to EXIM by the obligor/buyer and all guarantors, if any. These efforts will include, as EXIM may direct, asset searches, site visits, negotiations, litigation, documentation of agreements, embargoing assets and executing upon assets. See attached PWS. When an individual AMD recovery contract ends but the recovery action is still pending resolution, we award follow-on contracts on a sole source basis to the original vendor (per FAR 16.505(2)(c)) as long as it is for the same recovery case(s). The rationale for this is the combination of contingency payment agreement and the frequent long length of the recovery process. With limited vendor availability, if we did not follow this practice, the original vendor could perform most of the work and the subsequent vendor would reap the rewards of any funds recovered. By awarding follow-on contracts in this manner, we establish fairness for the vendors in an unusual situation, retain good relations with a limited vendor pool for future needs, and therefore get the best long-term benefit to the government.

The procurement includes custom design and analysis of a slip ring in accordance with detailed specifications of the Statement of Work (SOW) to ensure it interfaces with the existing LRTS. The Contractor will be responsible for testing the slip ring in it is final configuration to include cooling systems, fittings, hoses, etc. for a minimum of 4 hours at 1400 RPM to demonstrate the unit meets the specified requirements. Additionally, the Contractor will develop an installation, disassembly, and service manual for the slip ring. The manual shall include detailed installation and disassembly instructions with pictures and references to the model and tool part numbers. The service manual shall include replace intervals for bearings, rings, brush sets, and other serviceable parts. The manual shall include operational limits (temperature, speed, and fault frequencies etc.) limits. The service manual shall include an appendix with all the manufactures\u2019 specifications sheets for the bearings, seals, etc. The Contractor will provide hardware to include two (2) complete slip ring assembly kits. The kits shall include all required cooling connectors, hoses, and electrical connectors. A lubrication and cooling system pump cart. Spare lubrication cooling fluid for the cooling system. NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) intends to issue a sole source contract to Aerodyn Engineering LLC, 1919 S Girls School Rd, Indianapolis, IN. The item is being acquired under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 1901 and in accordance with FAR 13.5 procedures. It has been determined that Aerodyn is the most advantageous provider of this item. Aerodyn offers a unique capability to meet these demanding requirements in a compact/high speed rotor shaft. The slip ring is required to operate at 1400 RPM and provide 100 Million+ revolutions of service life. Aerodyn offers a unique capability to meet the requirements of high speeds and number of revolutions by actively cooling and lubricating the slip ring. Aerodyn\u2019s slip ring technologies have been proven on several government and industry projects. The Government has used other brands of slip rings in previous rotor testing. These slip rings require a significant amount of maintenance and generate noisy electrical data. The maintenance costs are extremely expensive due to the occupancy cost of the wind tunnels which they are used in. The noisy electrical data results in poor data quality and degrades the value of the research. Provision for this JOFOC is made under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). FAR Part 13.5 procedures are used under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(g)(4) which requires NASA to follow 41 U.S.C.1901(e). Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort electronically via email to Michael Devine at michael.p.devine@nasa.gov not later than Tuesday 04 MAR 2025 at 4:30pm EST. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this acquisition on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

BBD\u2019s IV&V tasks require obtaining numerous microorganisms in a viable form that can be recovered into active cultures. BBD\u2019s IV&V tasks also require limited distribution of the viable microorganisms to performers in DARPA\u2019s AMPHORA program in the form of contrived samples, or mixtures of microorganisms with complex matrices to simulate real world samples such as environmental wipes, sanitary wastewater, and clinical samples. Of the approximately 140 microorganisms originally specified by DARPA, BBD has an outstanding need for 40 microorganisms to be addressed by this acquisition. Of these 40 microorganisms, 17 are regulated for importation and inter-state transport by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA) as known pathogens to either livestock and poultry or plants. To successfully fulfill this requirement, three critical requirements must be met by the prospective contractor: At least 35 of the remaining 40 microorganisms must be obtained for BBD to deliver this task for the AMPHORA program. The timeline of BBD's IV&V tasks for the DARPA AMPHORA program that require BBD to provide a first shipment of contrived samples to AMPHORA performers in mid-April 2025. Contractor must be able to supply the required microorganisms under terms that allow NIST to redistribute the microorganisms in a viable form for conducing BBD's tasks under DARPA IAA. Contractor must have the ability to supply the 17 USDA APHIS regulated microorganisms from U.S. (domestic) origin. BBD currently holds a valid, U.S Origin/Inter-State Transport Only USDA APHIS transport permit for livestock and poultry pathogens, and BBD is currently awaiting final grant of equivalent transport permit for plant pathogens. Extensive market research was conducted, including a Sources Sought posting, which has concluded that the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), operating through its Federal Services program, is the only responsible source capable of satisfying the above three critical requirements. Six other contractors were identified during market research and all of them failed to meet at least one of the three critical requirements. Given these facts, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). is the only source reasonably available to fulfill the requirement. The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price purchase order. The NAICS Code is 325414 - Biological Product (except Diagnostic) Manufacturing with a size standard of 1250 employees. No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by the deadline will be considered by the Government. Responses must be submitted via email to the Government point of contact listed in this posting. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The applicable Product/Service Code is R418. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541110 - Office of Lawyers, which has a size standard of $11.0M. This requirement is to assist EXIM in its efforts to collect outstanding amounts owed to EXIM by the obligor/buyer and all guarantors, if any. These efforts will include, as EXIM may direct, asset searches, site visits, negotiations, litigation, documentation of agreements, embargoing assets and executing upon assets. See attached PWS. When an individual AMD recovery contract ends but the recovery action is still pending resolution, we award follow-on contracts on a sole source basis to the original vendor (per FAR 16.505(2)(c)) as long as it is for the same recovery case(s). The rationale for this is the combination of contingency payment agreement and the frequent long length of the recovery process. With limited vendor availability, if we did not follow this practice, the original vendor could perform most of the work and the subsequent vendor would reap the rewards of any funds recovered. By awarding follow-on contracts in this manner, we establish fairness for the vendors in an unusual situation, retain good relations with a limited vendor pool for future needs, and therefore get the best long-term benefit to the government.

    "description": "{\"description\":\"Synopsis \u2013 83310125Q0014 | Claims in the Dominican Republic EXIM Bank, headquartered in Washington, D.C., is providing this notice of intent to issue a sole source follow-on award to provide asset protection and recovery services. The applicable Product/Service Code is R418. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541110 - Office of Lawyers, which has a size standard of $11.0M. This requirement is to assist EXIM in its efforts to collect outstanding amounts owed to EXIM by the obligor/buyer and all guarantors, if any. These efforts will include, as EXIM may direct, asset searches, site visits, negotiations, litigation, documentation of agreements, embargoing assets and executing upon assets. See attached PWS. When an individual AMD recovery contract ends but the recovery action is still pending resolution, we award follow-on contracts on a sole source basis to the original vendor (per FAR 16.505(2)(c)) as long as it is for the same recovery case(s). The rationale for this is the combination of contingency payment agreement and the frequent long length of the recovery process. With limited vendor availability, if we did not follow this practice, the original vendor could perform most of the work and the subsequent vendor would reap the rewards of any funds recovered. By awarding follow-on contracts in this manner, we establish fairness for the vendors in an unusual situation, retain good relations with a limited vendor pool for future needs, and therefore get the best long-term benefit to the government.

    "description": "{\"description\":\"The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with HITACHI HIGH-TECH AMERICA, INC., 1375 N 28TH AVE, DALLAS, TX 75261-5012, for the purchase of a base plus 1.5 year option period service agreement for the NIST owned Hitachi S5500 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to be utilized by NIST\u2019s Physical Measurements Laboratory (PML) Microsystems and Nanotechnology Division (MND), Nanostructure Fabrication and Measurement Group (NFMG). The statutory authority for this acquisition is 41 USC 3304(a)(1); FAR 13.106-1(b). The CHIPS R&D Program\u2019s mission is to advance the development of semiconductor technologies and to enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry. The Electron-Solid Interactions Project contributes to the mission by developing and validating physics-based models of electron-solid interactions. Good models improve the accuracy of quantitative interpretations of data acquired by SEMs and other electron-beam-based measurement tools. The work takes place within NIST\u2019s Physical Measurement Laboratory, Microsystems and Nanotechnology Division, which has the mission of advancing the state of the art in nanofabrication, enabling the transfer of NIST measurement technologies to the industrial, academic, and government communities. A comprehensive market survey was conducted to discover vendors capable of providing the required maintenance services for the above referenced SEM. The goal of this procurement is for the S5500 to remain operational 24 hours per day and 7 days per week during the agreement period while meeting or exceeding the manufacturer\u2019s rated performance specifications. The service contract will provide routine preventive maintenance (PM), emergency services, repair, and calibration for the S5500. The service contract will minimize interruptions in service via preventive maintenance and minimize downtime via rapid diagnosis and repair by qualified and experienced personnel. Survey results determined HITACHI HIGH-TECH AMERICA, INC., as the original equipment manufacturer, is the only company with the proprietary knowledge, resources, and capability to provide maintenance services for this equipment. HITACHI HIGH-TECH AMERICA, INC. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the services that meets the required minimum specifications. All components and replacement parts are to be genuine Hitachi brand name to insure 100% compatibility with the existing instrument. The use of a third party would increase the chances of project deadlines slipping, negatively affecting the project results and the progress of the research. HITACHI HIGH-TECH AMERICA, INC. is uniquely qualified to provide the necessary service agreement. The Contractor has proprietary advantages for instrument maintenance: (1) Its service technicians are trained to service its instruments. (2) Service technicians have access to factory experts, company proprietary service manuals, and maintenance passwords that are not shared with third parties. (3) Service contract holders receive access to stocked parts and priority for parts that must be manufactured and shipped from Japan. NIST will also receive priority service for an unlimited number of service calls in the event of an instrument failure that requires immediate repair. For such calls, the response (time from first call for emergency service until a qualified service engineer arrives on site) will be within 48 hr. NIST researchers rely on the availability of the equipment and adding risks for increased service times does not support the best interest of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811210 \u2013 Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance, with a small business size standard of $34M revenue A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. Interested parties that believe they can satisfy the requirements listed above must identify their capability in writing before the response date of this notice. Only responses received by the established date and time shall be considered by the government. Responses shall be submitted via email to joni.laster@nist.gov.\"}",

    "description": "{\"description\":\"Each fiscal year (FY), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), as part of the Small Business Outreach Program, virtually conducts ten sessions of 15-minute pre-arranged meetings with small businesses. Vendor Outreach Sessions (VOS) provides small businesses with a platform to discuss their capabilities, learn about DHS procurements, and meet with large businesses to discuss subcontracting and partnering opportunities. We reserve four sessions for women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, small disadvantaged (including 8(a) and HUBZone small businesses. VOS is conducted by DHS Small Business Specialists (SBS) from each operational contracting component and large businesses (\u201ccounselors\u201d).?The next DHS VOS is March 27, 2025. This session is reserved for ALL Small Businesses. Refer to the?DHS VOS FY 2025 Schedule?to view or download the calendar and read the?Small Business Vendor Outreach Sessions\u2019?instructions carefully. Effective October 1, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2023 VOS), there are significant changes to the VOS Program: It matches small businesses to counselors by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes or core competencies. There is no longer a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d approach to VOS meetings. After being matched by the scheduling system, small businesses must request meetings with the counselors. You can request up to three business days after each VOS opens. The meeting request will undergo review, and the counselors will decide if the request meets current capability needs. After acceptance, we will send a meeting confirmation email to the small business to include a link to the virtual meeting information. Small businesses with confirmed meetings will view their meeting dashboard in the?DHS Vendor Outreach Scheduling System. Small businesses without a confirmation email or a confirmed meeting in the dashboard do not have a meeting scheduled and cannot take part in the VOS for that specific month. Meeting spaces are still limited. Meeting requests for the March 27, 2025, VOS will begin on March 13, 2025, at 12:00 noon, eastern standard time (EST) and close on March 18, 2025, at 11:59 p.m., EST. Please read the instructions carefully at Small Business Vendor Outreach Sessions | Homeland Security (dhs.gov).?Be aware that requesting a meeting does not guarantee a meeting and each counselor (SBS and large business) will only accept meetings that support their needs. NOTE:?All small businesses that have previously registered to take part in a VOS must update their profile to complete additional mandatory fields. For example, NAICS Codes and a capability statement are now required. Some businesses may need to re-register.?If you have previously met with a DHS component within the last three months, please consider this before registering for any VOS. Directly contact the?component small business specialists?to schedule a follow-up discussion outside of VOS instead.?This allows more opportunities for other small businesses who have not met with DHS to request a meeting and discuss their capabilities. Each profile must include a valid email address compatible with various virtual meeting tools (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams, WebEx, etc.). If connectivity issues occur using the virtual VOS links provided, expect to conduct the session telephonically. There are some DHS components that cannot access certain virtual tools. In those instances, we consider Microsoft Teams the preferred tool.? There is no fee for VOS. Please report any fee related inquiries and questions regarding the VOS.\"}",
